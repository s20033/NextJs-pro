## 1. Shortened Notification Deadline

Starting July 1, 2024, the deadline for submitting a notification of employment for a Ukrainian citizen will be reduced from 14 days to 7 days. Currently, a Ukrainian citizen legally residing in Poland can work for any employer without needing a work permit, provided they submit a notification via the praca.gov.pl portal. Employers will now have only 7 days from the date of employment or assignment to submit this notification.

<TopTip>
  Ensure that your HR department is prepared for the shortened notification deadline to avoid any compliance issues.

## 2. Updated Notification Requirements

The new amendments clarify that a notification must be submitted when there are changes such as: alterations in the type of contract, changes in position or type of work, reductions in working hours or the number of hours per week/month, or decreases in the wage rate specified in the notification.

These clarifications aim to ensure that all significant changes are promptly reported to maintain accurate records.

## 3. Extended Temporary Protection Period

The new legislation extends the period of temporary protection for Ukrainian citizens in Poland until September 30, 2025. This extension will please many Ukrainian citizens, but it also means that the regulations concerning the absence of sanctions for administrative officials during the processing of residence permit applications are extended as well. Foreigners who are not Ukrainian citizens will not be able to expedite their residence permit processes under this extended protection.
